* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite lab of mine due to learning how to use command-line
    argumemts in order to receive an output. Specifically in this lab, we used
    command-line arguments in order to figure out what sandwich we were getting. It
    was interesting seeing the different combinations we could make.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was another interesting lab of mine as it used a lot of mathematics
    when creating the code. While calculating the average of numbers on paper is not
    too complicated, figuring out how to implement that in a way the computer could
    understand was a fun challenge to complete.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was an interesting lab which dealt with real world data that we had
    to use in order to complete this code. Being able to use that data in order to
    find out the population of every county in California was interesting 
    introduction into using actual data in our code.
